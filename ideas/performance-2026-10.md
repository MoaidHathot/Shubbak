# Performance pass, 2026-10-28

Starting revision: `1e7a905`. Compatibility scope is the user's configuration, the
bundled programs and examples. Preserve keyboard input and visible behavior while
reducing work; commit and compare each step. See `keyboard-latency.md` for the preceding
correctness work and the limits of synthetic application input measurements.

## Baseline and method

The installed five native executables and session were saved under the approved temp
directory `shubbak-performance-20261028/baseline`. Native benchmark probes are retained
under `artifacts/performance/`; output folders are never overwritten. Other software
is running on this PC. Timings are interleaved, background CPU is recorded, and builds
and tests are kept outside measurement windows. Allocation counts and deterministic
geometry checks complement noisy wall/CPU time.

The fresh equal-work probe warms 1,000 operations then measures 20,000 operations.
Initial four rounds (32 nested mixed-state windows, all built-in layouts):

| Work | Allocated bytes/operation | CPU ms/operation | Wall seconds |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 KiB pipe request/reply | 72,675–72,685 | 0.247–0.250 | 3.56–3.70 |
| Complete layout | 5,992 | 0.0031–0.0047 | 0.095–0.097 |
| Layout + inverse resize | 14,342 | 0.0125–0.0133 | 0.252–0.255 |

Layout CPU samples are short relative to process-counter resolution; later comparisons
use longer loops. Both layout cases produced checksum `-7434308080712238633` in every
round. These are observer-inclusive operation costs, not keyboard callback timing.

The IPC result justifies addressing its character-at-a-time reader before client
refresh consolidation: the reader's async machinery is paid once per character.
The native keyboard baseline additionally covers idle, animated windows and paced
IPC queries in four rounds, retaining raw edges and process resource deltas.
